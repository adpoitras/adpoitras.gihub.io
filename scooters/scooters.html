          <li> I used all the experience I gained building the first two to create the ultimate version</li>
          <li> it features a fully custom chassis with front and rear pneumatic suspension, with power generated
            by a 4.4 kW motor and a larger custom made battery</li>

        <p class="text">When I first set out on creating my own electric scooter, I did not have much to work with. This
          was
          for a high school project, so I only had two months to do it. I had the experience with brushless motor
          control from building
          a quadcopter, though I did not have much knowledge in mechanical design. Nonetheless, I had a 3d printer and a
          few ideas.
        </p>
        <p class="text">I immediately decided to retrofit a Razor kick scooter with motors, as building a whole scooter
          was just simply
          beyond my scope at the time. I had to work with the very small chassis, so most of my parts were "tacked on".
          Initially I did not think
          there was enough space to fit a chain sprocket assembly in the back, so the motor was connected to a small
          drive wheel that was pressed
          against the main wheel with a spring. This didn't really work, as the wheel would just spin and settle on a
          groove. I then realized I could
          fit a small chain in there with a custom 3d printed sprocket that directly interfaced with the wheel spoke
          geometry.
